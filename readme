---------------------

This code is an (almost) standalone library for reading OriginLab project files.

It is based on the code at
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/liborigin
	http://soft.proindependent.com/liborigin2
and is API compatible with liborigin2 above

AUTHORS:  Stefan Gerlach, Ion Vasilief, Alex Kargovsky

DEPENDENCIES: to compile, liborigin2 (still) depends on
		BOOST C++ libraries  http://www.boost.org/
			boost/algorithm/string.hpp, boost/variant.hpp and its dependencies.
		tree.hh (included) http://tree.phi-sci.com/
		Note that the BOOST libraries are not needed at run time,
		neither are linked in the executable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILING: liborigin2 uses qmake for the building process.
		qmake is part of a Qt distribution: http://trolltech.com/

After installing qmake and the BOOST C++ library headers on your system, issue the following commands:
	$ qmake
	$ make
	$ make staticlib
