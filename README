TODO :
	U Crash on 1kW_Diode.OPJ 	-> works on Linux
	U Crash on fano.OPJ	 	-> works on Linux

	-------
X	V Crash on Fred2_....OPJ
	O check tachyone.OPJ, test.OPJ, CaFChargenvergleich.OPJ
	V crash on backup.opj
		-> cname==0 but no matrix !
	* read spreadsheet infos (LAYER section) with better method
		-> check out examples
	* support MATRIX tables
		* check older project versions (6.0,5.0,etc.)
			-> size always 0
		* get column/row numbers -> resize matrix
			* check ws+matrix.opj
			5x2 & 2x5	: 0x215 / 0x23D
		* check all matrix examples (also mixed)
	* fix reading of mixed columns in file
		-> SiGe example
	* support FUNCTION : drf_spin, tachyonen2.OPJ
	* read graphs
	* support extra graph (no link to data) : power_cdw
	* fix various problems (check ORIGIN/README)
	*  support for Origin's standalone file formats
		It would be cool if liborigin could recognize some of
		Origins's standdalone file formats:
		*.ogg (graphic), and perhaps *.otw (template) and *.ogs (LabTalk Scripts)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* hex dump opj files :
	hexdump -C file.opj > file.dump

* check all projects within labplot (to check that it doesn't crash)
	LabPlot import.qs
